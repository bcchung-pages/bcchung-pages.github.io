## AI based multi-path selection

<center><img src="/assets/research1.png"></center>


Multi-media multi-path(MMMP) system is a system in which utilizes various networks simultaneously. 
It is expected that MMMP system can enhance communication speed, reliability, security of network.
In this research, we focus on intelligent network control in MMMP system.
Recurrent neural network(RNN) is applied to predict the network performance, according to the previous time-series network performance parameters.
Moreover, we implemented testbed learning server to evaluate the performance of proposed algorithm.

## Cascade AI structure for detecting network intrusion

<center><img src="/assets/research2.png"></center>

Artificial intelligence(AI) is applied to improve accuracy in network intrusion.
AI is a great optimization method, but the problem of lack of data often arises.
To solve this problem, we suggest cascade AI structure to solve data labeling problem.
By applying unsupervised learning, we can reduce the difficulty of data labelling.

## Next-generation communication systems

Future networks will become more complex depending on user/service requirements.
Delicate optimization is required to meet these requirements.
In order to reduce the complexity of existing optimization, we are interested in multi-agent learning, neural networks and game-theoretic modeling.
