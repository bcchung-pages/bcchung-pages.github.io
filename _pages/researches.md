## AI based multi-path selection

<center><img src="/assets/research1.png"></center>

Multi-media multi-path(MMMP) system is a system in which utilizes various networks simultaneously. 
It is expected that MMMP system can enhance communication speed, reliability, security of network.
In this research, we focus on path selection in MMMP system.
Recurrent neural network(RNN) is applied to predict the network performance, according to the previous time-series network performance parameters.
Moreover, we implemented testbed learning server to evaluate the performance of proposed algorithm.
